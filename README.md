# Item-Catalog-Project

**Project Overview:**
Develop an application that provides a list of items within a variety of categories as well as provide a user registration and authentication system. Registered users will have the ability to post, edit and delete their own items.

**Why This Project?**
Modern web applications perform a variety of functions and provide amazing features and utilities to their users; but deep down, it’s really all just creating, reading, updating and deleting data. In this project, you’ll combine your knowledge of building dynamic websites with persistent data storage to create a web application that provides a compelling service to your users.

**What Will I Learn?**
- Develop a RESTful web application using the Python framework Flask along with implementing third-party OAuth authentication.  
- When to properly use the various HTTP methods available to you and how these methods relate to CRUD (create, read, update and delete) operations.

**Pre-requisites:**
- Virtual Machine
- Vagrant
- Python 2.7

**Here's what you should do:**
1. Install Vagrant and VirtualBox
2. Launch the Vagrant VM (vagrant up)
3. Type command "vagrant ssh" or "winpty vagrant ssh"(if using windows OS).
4. In VM, type "cd /vagrant"
5. Run "python database_setup.py" to create the database.
6. Run "python lotsofmenus.py" to add the menu items
7. Run "python project.py"
8. Access and test the application by visiting http://localhost:5000 locally
